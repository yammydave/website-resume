                    <h2>WEB DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>My forte is not in the field of web design, however have appreciation for both form and function.
                        Further, I am not the client; my own preferences matter not, yours do. It is my job to meet your website needs and wants. 
                        There is no shortage of artistically designed websites on the net from where I can
                        gain inspiration to please my customers. Why reinvent the wheel?

                    <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
                    <p>As a junior developer, I am eager to grow my reputation to further my career, 
                        I depend heavily on recommendations and gaining kudos. Therefore it is in both our interests that 
                        the site I build you, pulls in the traffic needed to help you keep your business ahead.
                        By doing so, it will then indirectly build mine. 
                        What use is the most beautiful of sites if nobody sees it?

                    <h2>Clean Code</h2>
                    <p>Optimised code, requires less room and runs faster, 
                        will would-be customers wait patiently for your site to load?
                        W3C is the main standards organisation for the World Wide Web.
                        The site I build you will be validated as meeting W3C standards and as such will proudly display their 
                        validation logos demonstrating professionalism to your clients.

                    <h2>Freedom </h2>
                    <p>If code is difficult to read you could be tied into a business relationship with the 
                        site builder regardless of how that relationship may proceed in the future.
                        My code is written such that anyone, suitably qualified and skilled, 
                        you appoint can maintain and manage your site, 
                        so you will always be in control. Is freedom to move should you desire important to you?

                    <p>As a junior developer keen to build a portfolio with no commercial experience to draw from, I built this website that can be accessed from the link below.
                        With version control a priority in the maintenance of websites, with as little downtime as possible, the site is hosted on Github Pages, evidenced through it's URL.
                        The site was constructed as a desktop site and then responsiveness to support mobile and tablet followed, unlike this site constructed vice versa.
                        That site made use of multiple CSS pages for header, sidebar etc whilst this site uses just one. These different approaches are to demonstrate my flexibilty of working.

                        Such a site provides me as the site builder opportunities to employ CSS animation and embed video sequences to bring it all to life.

                    <p>Klarissa-Charlene Faith was murdered by her ex-partner Stuart Hall on 30th July 2018 at her home in Harworth, Nottinghamshire.
                        Their 20 month old child was present thoughout. The pathologist's expert and un-opposed opinion was that Stuart Hall spent between four and five minutes concerted 
                        effort of manual strangulation to take her life.
                        Stuart Hall's adult son and oldest adult daughter with her partner attended the scene following the murder and spent another twenty minutes or so, before alerting the police, 
                        then reporting "a death by self-defence".
                        During his trial Stuart Hall and his family attempted to besmirch Klarissa's character, painting himself as the victim, in an attempt to provide justification for her murder.
                        This was so reported in the media. 
                        This site will provide evidence to the reality of Stuart Hall's abusive character, some of which was provided for the public trial and some which came to light 
                        in the Domestic Homicide Review that followed.
