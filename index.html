                    <h2>WEB DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>My forte is not in the field of web design, however have appreciation for both form and function.
                        Further, I am not the client; my own preferences matter not, yours do. It is my job to meet your website needs and wants. 
                        There is no shortage of artistically designed websites on the net from where I can
                        gain inspiration to please my customers. Why reinvent the wheel?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
                    <p>As a junior developer, I am eager to grow my reputation to further my career, 
                        I depend heavily on recommendations and gaining kudos. Therefore it is in both our interests that 
                        the site I build you, pulls in the traffic needed to help you keep your business ahead.
                        By doing so, it will then indirectly build mine. 
                        What use is the most beautiful of sites if nobody sees it?
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Clean Code</h2>
                    <p>Optimised code, requires less room and runs faster, 
                        will would-be customers wait patiently for your site to load?
                        W3C is the main standards organisation for the World Wide Web.
                        The site I build you will be validated as meeting W3C standards and as such will proudly display their 
                        validation logos demonstrating professionalism to your clients.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Freedom </h2>
                    <p>If code is difficult to read you could be tied into a business relationship with the 
                        site builder regardless of how that relationship may proceed in the future.
                        My code is written such that anyone, suitably qualified and skilled, 
                        you appoint can maintain and manage your site, 
                        so you will always be in control. Is freedom to move should you desire important to you?

                    <p>As a junior developer keen to build a portfolio, with no commercial experience to draw from, I built this website that can be accessed from the hyperlink built in the image.                        
                        <br>The site was constructed as a desktop site and then responsiveness to support mobile and tablet followed, unlike this site which was constructed vice-versa.
                        <br>That site made use of multiple CSS pages for header, sidebar etc whilst this site uses just one. 
                        <br>The reason behind the different approaches is to demonstrate my flexibilty of working.

                        <p>Wedding photos look great in an album but can look even better as a website, giving you the ability to share those happy moments with all those who attended, 
                            and as well as those that couldn't attend. 
                            <br>Such a site provides me as the site builder opportunities to employ different CSS techniques to bring it all to life.
                            Tristan and Meg will be involved throughout construction to ensure client satisfaction knowing it's their choice of photos, layout and effects that will be used.

                            The ritual of the bride walking through the village to the church was observed and captured for posterity.
                            Again like Tristan and Meg's site, Millie and Tom will be involved throughout, even past the point of the site going live and their domain registered.

                    <p>Klarissa-Charlene Faith was murdered by her ex-partner Stuart Hall on 30th July 2018 at her home in Doncaster; their child present thoughout.
                        Stuart Hall spent between four and five minutes concerted effort of manual strangulation to take Klarissa's life.
                        During his trial Stuart Hall and his family attempted to besmirch Klarissa's character, to provide murder justification; painting himself as the victim.
                        This site, using evidence provided for the public trial and the Domestic Homicide Review, will demonstrate the reality of Stuart Hall's abusive character.

                <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
                <p>In 2015 I graduated Sheffield Hallam University with a computing honours degree.
                    I am a family man with a large family, raising with Catherine, my partner, two young children.
                    We both have grown children, though sadly my daughter Clarissa was cruelly taken from us in 2018.
                    We are privileged to enjoy the peaceful village life of Blyton in the beautiful county of Lincolnshire where we live.
                    Such life encourages an enjoyment of nature, where we can walk, forage or I can indulge in my passion of motorcycling in our fantastic countryside.
                    Consequently I am happy working from home, or the office, or a combination of both.
                    I am equally happy to work in permanent employment, self-employment or freelance.

                            This affords you the opportunity to gain tremendous value for your money, you are unlikely to get elsewhere.
